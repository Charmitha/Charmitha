About Me: 

Hello, I'm Charmitha Garugu, a senior Computer Science Engineering Student with a knack for fusing technology, design, and management. My journey has been a blend of leadership, creativity, and code as I prepare to enter my new career.From aesthetics to algorithms, I've enjoyed the challenge of fusing coding and design to produce user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences. I have created user interfaces, thought about user-centric design principles, and given life to ideas that combine the best of both worlds throughout my academic career.
